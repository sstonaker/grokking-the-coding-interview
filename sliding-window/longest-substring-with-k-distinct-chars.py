"""Problem Statement

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more
than K distinct characters.

You can assume that K is less than or equal to the length of the given string.

Example 1:

Input: String="araaci", K=2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '2' distinct characters i
s "araa".
Example 2:

Input: String="araaci", K=1
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '1' distinct characters is
"aa".
Example 3:

Input: String="cbbebi", K=3
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substrings with no more than '3' distinct characters
are "cbbeb" & "bbebi"."""

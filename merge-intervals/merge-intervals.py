"""Problem Statement

Given a list of intervals, merge all the overlapping intervals to produce a
list that has only mutually exclusive intervals.

Example 1:

Intervals: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]
Output: [[1,5], [7,9]]
Explanation: Since the first two intervals [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, we merged
them into
one [1,5].

Example 2:

Intervals: [[6,7], [2,4], [5,9]]
Output: [[2,4], [5,9]]
Explanation: Since the intervals [6,7] and [5,9] overlap, we merged them into
one [5,9].

Example 3:

Intervals: [[1,4], [2,6], [3,5]]
Output: [[1,6]]
Explanation: Since all the given intervals overlap, we merged them into one.

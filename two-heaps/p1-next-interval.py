"""Problem Statement

Given an array of intervals, find the next interval of each interval. In a
list of intervals, for an interval `i` its next interval `j` will have the
smallest `start` greater than or equal to the `end` of `i`.

Write a function to return an array containing indices of the next interval of
each input interval. If there is no next interval of a given interval, return
-1. It is given that none of the intervals have the same start point.

Example 1:

Input: Intervals [[2,3], [3,4], [5,6]]
Output: [1, 2, -1]
Explanation: The next interval of [2,3] is [3,4] having index `1`. Similarly,
the next interval of [3,4] is [5,6] having index `2`. There is no next interval
for [5,6] hence we have `-1`.

Example 2:

Input: Intervals [[3,4], [1,5], [4,6]]
Output: [2, -1, -1]
Explanation: The next interval of [3,4] is [4,6] which has index `2`. There is
no next interval for [1,5] and [4,6].

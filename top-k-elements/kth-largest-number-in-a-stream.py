"""Problem Statement

Design a class to efficiently find the Kth largest element in a stream of
numbers.

The class should have the following two things:

The constructor of the class should accept an integer array containing initial
numbers from the stream and an integer `K`.
The class should expose a function add(int num) which will store the given
number and return the Kth largest number.
Example 1:

Input: [3, 1, 5, 12, 2, 11], K = 4
1. Calling add(6) should return '5'.
2. Calling add(13) should return '6'.
2. Calling add(4) should still return '6'.
